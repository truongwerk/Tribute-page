          <strong>1902</strong>-Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1905</strong>-Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory

        <li>
          <strong>1909</strong>-After working at the patent office and writing
          his theories, Einstein got a job teaching theoretical physics at the

        <li>
          <strong>1911</strong>-He was given an invitation to the first-ever

        <li>
          <strong>1913</strong>-He believed science's understanding of gravity
          was wrong, and he worked on a new theory which he would later test

        <li>
          <strong>1919</strong>-After publishing his Theory of Relativity and

          research. He made advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he
